string = tf.Variable([[3,2],[4,1]],tf.int16)
string1 = tf.reshape(string,[1,-1])
reshape changes dimension above code puts everything into 1 list -1 denotes that it calculates how many should go there
t = tf.ones([5,5,5])
t  = tf.reshape(t,[1,-1])

linear regression
given x predict y data point
scalable to higher dimensions
data needs to be corelated
could draw line of best fit
